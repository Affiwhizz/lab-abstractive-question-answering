# Lab | Abstractive Question Answering — Engineering Report

## Overview

This report documents how the original abstractive QA notebook was made to work end-to-end after multiple breakages (deprecated dataset, API/config frictions, noisy outputs). It focuses on **what changed**, **problems encountered**, **how they were solved**, and **the final behavior** of the system.


## System

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline:

1. **Indexer (offline)**
   - Load a Wikipedia-style dataset.
   - Clean/normalize text.
   - Embed each passage with a sentence-transformer.
   - Upsert vectors into a Pinecone serverless index (dimension 384, cosine).

2. **Retriever (online)**
   - Encode the user question.
   - Query Pinecone for *top-k* similar passages.
   - Return matches (optionally with metadata).

3. **Generator (online)**
   - Concatenate question + retrieved context into a single prompt.
   - Use a seq-to-seq model to generate an abstractive answer.
   - Post-process the text to reduce obvious repetition.
   - Print a 'clean-only result' (scores/contexts are suppressed).


## Key Changes Made

### 1) Replaced the Original Dataset
- **Problem**: The lab’s original dataset (`vblagoje/wikipedia_snippets_streamed`) stopped resolving on Hugging Face. Loading failed with:
  - `ValueError: No data files found in dataset directory`
- **Change**: Switched to a stable public snapshot:
  - `"wikipedia", "20220301.en"` (sampled subset for speed).
- **Reason**: Keeps the lab functional without relying on a removed dataset.

### 2) New Preprocessing Steps (to match the pipeline)
- The replacement dataset schema differed from the original. I:
  - Kept a single text column (`content`).
  - Dropped empty rows.
  - Stripped whitespace.
  - Truncated passages (e.g., first 500 chars) to keep embedding cost and prompt size under control.

### 3) Pinecone Setup & Indexing
- **Index**: Serverless (cosine, 384 dims) to match `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`.
- **Upsert**: Batched uploads of `(id, embedding, optional metadata)`.
- **Re-use on reruns**: If the index exists, connect instead of recreating.

### 4) Retriever & Generator Initialization
- **Retriever model**: `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (fast, 384-dim).
- **Generator model**: HF `google/flan-t5-base` (instruction-tuned, robust for QA).
- **Prompt format**:  
  `"Question: <q>\nContext: <joined top-k snippets>\nAnswer:"`

### 5) Output Clean-Up (No Debug Noise)
- **Removed** printing of:
  - raw retrieval scores,
  - top-k snippets block,
  - Pinecone match objects.
- **Kept**: Only the **question** and the **generated answer**.
- **Added**: Minimal repetition de-dupe (token-level joining) to lessen duplicate phrases some models produce.


## Environment & API

- **Pinecone key** was placed in environment variables and verified (simple presence check).  
- If a Colab runtime lost the environment, I re-initialized Pinecone with the API key again.


## Problems I hit and how I fixed them

### A) Dataset Unavailable
- **Symptom**: Loading the lab’s dataset failed.
- **Fix**: Switched to `"wikipedia", "20220301.en"` and sampled a small training slice.

### B) Metadata Missing in Matches
- **Symptom**: Some matches lacked a `metadata` object → `KeyError: 'metadata'`.
- **Fix**: Safe extraction pattern (use `.get("metadata", {})`) so empty items don’t crash the pipeline.

### C) Pinecone Key Not Detected on Reconnect
- **Symptom**: After Colab disconnects, `pinecone.init` fails if env is gone.
- **Fix**: Re-set `PINECONE_API_KEY` into `os.environ` and re-init the client.

### D) Over-verbose, Repetitive Answers
- **Symptom**: Model repeated clauses (common with seq-to-seq on short prompts).
- **Fix**: Light post-processing to reduce immediate duplicate tokens/phrases. Also kept answers short (max length cap).

### E) Noisy Notebook Output
- **Symptom**: Scores, top-k snippets, and raw objects cluttered the display.
- **Fix**: Consolidated to a single helper (`ask`) that prints only the question and the final generated answer. Removed score/context printing completely.

The final notebook shows a neat, two-line block per query: **Question** and **Generated Answer**.


## Observed Outputs
- **Q:** *What causes earthquakes?*  
  **A:** `I'm not a geologist, but I do have a degree in seismology. I'm not sure if  this is what you're looking for, but I can give you a general idea`

- **Q:** *What is artificial intelligence?*  
  **A:** `Artificial intelligence is the ability of a computer to learn and adapt  ' 'its environment. It its 'environment. a')`

- **Q:** *What is the difference between AI and ML?*  
  **A:** `AI is the process of making a computer do something. ML  ' 'making something.'`

- **Q:** *How does machine learning work?*  
  **A:** `No relevant contexts found above the score threshold.`

- **Q:** *When was the first car invented?*  
  **A:** `The first car was invented in the early 19th century. The  ' 'probably a bicycle. bicycle late 18th 'The in')`

- **Q:** *what is consciousness?*  
  **A:** `I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but I'll give it a shot.  " "Consciousness the ability to think. It's physical thin …`  
  *(truncated in the notebook view)*

- **Q:** *How does AI improve customer experience?*  
  **A:** `No relevant contexts found above the score threshold.`

> Notes on these outcomes:
> - The “No relevant contexts…” lines are the intended behavior when retrieval returns only low-score matches after filtering.
> - The short repeated quotes/odd tokens are a known artifact with small T5-style models on sparse context. I logged them and mitigated with the duplicate-token clean-up.


## Why Some Answers Look Garbled

- **Sparse or off-topic context** (small sample from a large Wikipedia dump) + **short prompts** ⇒ generator has weak guidance.
- **Small model** (`flan-t5-base`) ⇒ more prone to brief repetition or clipped clauses.
- **Token post-processing** reduces obvious dupes but can expose quote characters where the model emitted them inconsistently.


## What Worked

- Index creation and upsert completed successfully (vector counts matched expectations).
- Retrieval returned matches; low-score filtering prevented irrelevant passages from polluting the prompt.
- Generation produced answers for most questions; when context was inadequate, the system reported that no strong context was found.

## Reproduction Steps

1. **Install deps**: datasets, sentence-transformers, transformers, pinecone-client, torch.
2. **Load data**: `"wikipedia", "20220301.en"`; sample a tiny split for speed.
3. **Clean**: keep `content` text, drop NaNs, strip whitespace, truncate to ~500 chars.
4. **Embeddings**: `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` → 384-dim vectors.
5. **Pinecone**: init with API key; create/connect to serverless index; upsert vectors.
6. **Retriever**: encode query; `index.query(top_k=K, include_metadata=True)`; safe metadata extraction.
7. **Generator**: `flan-t5-base` with prompt `"Question …\nContext …\nAnswer:"`; limit length; decode.
8. **ask()**: print only the **question** and the **cleaned generated answer**.


## Known Limitations

- Small model can repeat or hedge; longer, structured prompts help.
- Random Wikipedia sample; context may be irrelevant for niche questions.
- No caching; re-embedding on large sets will be slow if repeated.


## Future Improvements

- Switch to `flan-t5-large` or `mixtral`-class generators if compute allows.
- Use **domain-focused** corpora (or larger Wikipedia slice) to improve retrieval quality.
- Add **prompt templates** (question re-statement, bullet context, explicit constraints).
- Add a simple **guard** (e.g., verify answer spans in retrieved context).
- Introduce **client-side caching** and **batch queries** for speed.


## Deliverable Status

- Notebook runs end-to-end with the replacement dataset.
- Pinecone index is populated and queried successfully.
- Output is **minimal and clean** (no scores/contexts printed).
- All major issues and fixes are documented above.
